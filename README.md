# My .tmux.conf configuration file  

This repo is a backup of my personal tmux configuration file. To enable the settings, you can put the `.tmux.conf` file in your home directory. 

I make my tmux configurations as per the instruction and recommendations in **tmux - Productive Mouse-free Development**. By the way, it's a great book.
